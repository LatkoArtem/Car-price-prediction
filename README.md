Used Car Price Prediction using Stacking Ensemble: I developed a comprehensive ML pipeline to predict used car prices by integrating Kaggle competition data with the original dataset. I performed extensive feature engineering, utilizing Regex to extract engine specifications (HP, liters, cylinders) and creating custom brand tiers. I implemented a two-stage modeling strategy, starting with a CatBoost classifier to generate a "price outlier" probability meta-feature, which achieved an AUC of 0.8877. Subsequently, I trained a bagged ensemble (3 bags, 10 folds) where individual models yielded the following OOF RMSE scores: LightGBM (Model 1) – 73,441, LightGBM (Model 2) – 73,561, and CatBoost Regressor – 73,358. I optimized hyperparameters using Optuna and aggregated final predictions using Ridge Regression stacking, which improved the validation RMSE to 73,225. Ultimately, I achieved a Private Score of 63159.07806.Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost
